# Event-Checkin (de.systopia.eventcheckin)

## Scope

An extension to provide check-in links and QR codes to CiviCRM event
participants, so they can check in with the event's front desk, or even
automatically.

When a check-in link is used (e.g. by scanning a QR-code) users with appropriate
permissions will be presented with a screen that shows information and allows
checking in the participant, thus changing its status (e.g. to "attended"). It
also provides an API to allow a remote system to do this.

## Features

* Generates check-in links and QR codes for participants
* Provides a form for users with appropriate permissions to check in
  participants after scanning te QR code
* Allows for including links and/or QR codes in emails and documents created in
  CiviCRM

## Dependencies

The
extension ["Event Communication" (de.systopia.eventmessages)](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.eventmessages)
is required to include the links and QR codes in e-mail and/or documents
generated by CiviCRM. You could also use the two extensions to create event
tickets including QR codes and set up automated workflows for sending them out
via e-mail based on the participant's role and/or registration status.

The extension ["Remote Tools" (de.systopia.remotetools)](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.remotetools) is required before installation.

This extension uses
[Chillerlan's QR code generator](https://github.com/chillerlan/php-qrcode) to
generate QR codes.
